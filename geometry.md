## Unused Functions in geometry.rs and Their Purpose:

### 1. **KdTree-related Functionality**

```rust
impl KdTree {
    pub fn new() -> Self                    // Create empty k-d tree
    pub fn build(points: &[Point]) -> Self  // Build k-d tree from point cloud
    pub fn nearest_neighbor(&self, query: &Point) -> Option<Point>  // Nearest neighbor search
}
```

**Purpose**: Data structure for fast nearest neighbor search
**Use cases**:

- Efficient search for the closest point from a large set (O(log n))
- k-NN classification in machine learning
- Enemy character search in games
- GIS applications

### 2. **Extended Functionality for Point Structure**

```rust
impl Point {
    pub fn new(x: f64, y: f64) -> Self                        // Create point
    pub fn distance_squared_to(&self, other: &Point) -> f64   // Distance squared (faster)
}
```

**Purpose**:

- `new()` → More explicit point creation
- `distance_squared_to()` → Speed optimization by avoiding square root calculation (sufficient for comparisons)

### 3. **LineSegment-related Functions**

```rust
pub struct LineSegment {
    pub start: Point,
    pub end: Point,
}

impl LineSegment {
    pub fn new(start: Point, end: Point) -> Self              // Create line segment
    pub fn intersects(&self, other: &LineSegment) -> bool     // Line segment intersection test
}
```

**Purpose**: Basic elements of computational geometry
**Use cases**:

- CAD software
- Road intersection detection in map applications
- Collision detection in games
- Path planning in robotics

### 4. **Advanced Geometric Algorithms**

```rust
pub fn find_intersecting_segments(segments: &[LineSegment]) -> Vec<(usize, usize)>
```

**Purpose**: Detect all intersecting pairs among multiple line segments
**Use cases**:

- Wire routing checks in circuit board design
- Interference checking in architectural drawings

## Why They’re Currently Unused:

Current benchmark only uses:

```rust
// Only closest pair problem is used
crate::geometry::closest_pair_divide_conquer(points)
```

**Originally intended extensions**:

- **Performance comparison**: Brute force vs K-d tree for nearest neighbor search
- **Complex geometric problems**: Line intersection, convex hull, Voronoi diagrams, etc.
- **Real-world applications**: Use in GPS navigation, game physics engines

## Additional Unused Functions in geometry.rs:

### 5. **`convex_hull_graham_scan()`**

```rust
pub fn convex_hull_graham_scan(points: &[Point]) -> Vec<Point>
```

**Purpose**: Convex Hull calculation using Graham Scan method
**Use cases**:

- **Game development**: Simplifying character collision detection
- **Image processing**: Boundary detection in object recognition
- **Robotics**: Path planning for obstacle avoidance
- **GIS**: Geographic region boundary calculation

**Algorithm**: Efficient convex hull algorithm with O(n log n) complexity

### 6. **Geometric Helper Functions**

#### **`polar_angle()`**

```rust
fn polar_angle(origin: &Point, point: &Point) -> f64
```

**Purpose**: Calculate polar angle (argument) from origin to specified point
**Usage**: Sort points by angle in Graham Scan

#### **`cross_product()`**

```rust
fn cross_product(o: &Point, a: &Point, b: &Point) -> f64
```

**Purpose**: Cross product calculation of 3 points (orientation determination)
**Use cases**:

- Determine which side of a line segment a point is on
- Polygon area calculation
- Rotation direction determination (clockwise/counterclockwise)

#### **`direction()`**

```rust
fn direction(pi: &Point, pj: &Point, pk: &Point) -> f64
```

**Purpose**: Calculate orientation of 3 points
**Usage**: Geometric primitive that forms the basis for line segment intersection tests

#### **`on_segment()`**

```rust
fn on_segment(pi: &Point, pj: &Point, pk: &Point) -> bool
```

**Purpose**: Determine if a point lies on a line segment
**Usage**: Handle special cases in line intersection (intersection at endpoints)

## Why Such Detailed Implementation?

### 1. **Academic Completeness**

- Comprehensive coverage of basic algorithms found in computational geometry textbooks
- Wanted to include various geometric problems as a “divide and conquer” project

### 2. **Real-world Demand**

- CAD/CAM software
- Physics calculations in game engines
- Path planning for autonomous vehicles
- Design support in architecture and civil engineering

### 3. **Algorithm Comparison Material**

**Originally intended extensions**:

```rust
// Performance comparison of convex hull algorithms
runner.benchmark_convex_hull("Graham Scan", &points);
runner.benchmark_convex_hull("Gift Wrapping", &points);

// Line intersection detection comparison
runner.benchmark_line_intersection("Brute Force", &segments);
runner.benchmark_line_intersection("Sweep Line", &segments);
```

### 7. **`find_intersecting_segments()`**

```rust
pub fn find_intersecting_segments(segments: &[LineSegment]) -> Vec<(usize, usize)>
```

## Purpose and Applications of This Function:

### **Functionality**

- Detect all intersecting pairs among multiple line segments
- Returns index pairs of intersecting line segments

### **Real-world Applications**

#### **1. CAD/Design Software**

```rust
// Wire routing check on circuit boards
let pcb_traces = vec![...];  // Traces on the board
let intersections = find_intersecting_segments(&pcb_traces);
if !intersections.is_empty() {
    println!("Warning: Wire intersections detected: {:?}", intersections);
}
```

#### **2. Architecture/Civil Engineering Design**

```rust
// Interference check for building beams and columns
let structural_elements = vec![...];
let conflicts = find_intersecting_segments(&structural_elements);
```

#### **3. Game Development**

```rust
// Intersection detection for lasers and projectile trajectories
let laser_beams = vec![...];
let collisions = find_intersecting_segments(&laser_beams);
```

#### **4. Maps/GIS**

```rust
// Intersection detection for roads and boundary lines
let roads = vec![...];
let crossroads = find_intersecting_segments(&roads);
```

### **Algorithmic Perspective**

Current implementation: **Brute Force O(n²)**

```rust
// Check all line segment pairs
for i in 0..segments.len() {
    for j in (i + 1)..segments.len() {
        if segments[i].intersects(&segments[j]) {
            intersections.push((i, j));
        }
    }
}
```

**More efficient implementation**: **Sweep Line Algorithm O(n log n)**

- “Sweep” a vertical line from left to right
- Manage only active line segments
- Fast processing even with large numbers of line segments

### **Originally Intended Extensions**

```rust
// Algorithm comparison benchmarks
runner.benchmark_intersection("Brute Force", &segments);
runner.benchmark_intersection("Sweep Line", &segments);
runner.benchmark_intersection("R-Tree", &segments);
```
