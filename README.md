## Abstract

This project implements and evaluates multiple divide and conquer algorithms for large-scale data processing, including sorting algorithms, matrix multiplication, and computational geometry problems. Through systematic performance analysis comparing debug and release builds, we demonstrate the practical effectiveness of divide and conquer strategies and provide empirical validation of theoretical complexity analysis.

## 1. Introduction

Divide and conquer algorithms represent a fundamental paradigm in computer science, offering elegant solutions to complex computational problems through recursive decomposition. This project investigates the practical implementation and performance characteristics of three core divide and conquer algorithms: sorting algorithms (Merge Sort and Quick Sort), Strassen’s matrix multiplication, and the closest pair of points problem.

The primary objectives of this research are to:

- Implement efficient divide and conquer algorithms using modern parallel processing techniques
